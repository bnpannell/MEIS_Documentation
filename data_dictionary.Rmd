## data Folder
This is a folder located in the main folder and is designed to hold data for this project.

### raw Folder
This folder is located within the data folder and contains all raw data provided to the user. The purpose of the raw data is to simplify the data processing. 

- **2007_to_2017_NAICS.xlsx:** This file contains the cross walk used in the master script to update 2007 NAICs codes to 2017 NAICs codes. This file is a new development to automate error checking when linking IMPLAN codes to NAICs codes. It is NOT used in the Deprecated master script. 
- **2012_2017_NAICS_to_IMPLAN.xlsx:** This file contains the 2017 NAICS to IMPLAN crosswalk (available online from IMPLAN), as well as several additions. 2012 NAICS to IMPLAN values were appended to this file in addition to several 2002 NAICs codes that required updating. This file is a new development to automate error checking when linking IMPLAN codes to NAICs codes. It is NOT used in the Deprecated master script. 
- **business_type_to_implan546_crosswalk.csv:** This file was created to serve as a crosswalk between grant recipient business types and their corresponding IMPLAN codes. This file was made by manually looking up each business type and entering its corresponding IMPLAN code value. 
- **contract_recipient_to_district_crosswalk.xlxs:** This file was created to serve as an aid to error checking by assigning a District values to certain contract data that lacked them. Creation of this file involved looking up addresses of businesses with no given District in order to correctly assign a District to the data. It is NOT used in the Deprecated master script.

#### Blank_Sheets_for_R Folder

- **HouseholdSpendingChange4.xlsx:**
- **IndustrySpendingPattern5.xlsx:**
- **InstitutionSpendingPattern6.xlsx**
- **LaborIncomeChange3.xlsx:**

#### deprecated Folder
This folder contains raw data only used by the Deprecated master script. 

- **2017_implan_online_naics_to_implan546.xlsx:** This file contains the crosswalk for linking 2017 IMPLAN codes to NAICs code. 
- **2021_employment_totals.xlsx:**

### temp Folder

## output Folder
This folder is within the main folder and holds all of the final output files needed by IMPLAN in order to complete this project. New output files will get created and placed into this folder as scripts are run.

- **placeholder.txt:** This file prevents Github from deleting the output folder, as it is empty by default.
