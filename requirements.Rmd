# Software Requirements

To recreate or replicate this study, specialized software is needed to obtain and process federal data. Fortunately, all the software that was used in this process is free and available online. *(Where possible, make sure to use the most recent and fully updated versions of the software).*

1. The R coding language from [cloud.r-project.org](https://cloud.r-project.org/). This language is used to obtain and process data.

2. RStudio Desktop from [rstudio.com](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). RStudio is the integrated development environment (IDE) used to run R scripts and develop code.

3. Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads). A comprehensive guide to installing Git is available at [happygitwithr.com](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html). Git allows version control of edits across a multi-person team of researchers. 

4. If a GitHub account is needed, one can sign up and register at <https://github.com/>. Individual free plans are available, as well as [free upgrades](https://help.github.com/en/articles/applying-for-an-educator-or-researcher-discount) for qualifying academic purposes. GitHub is used to develop and host this project. 

## Download Necessary R Packages
dplyr, httr, jsonlite, openxlsx, readxl, tidyverse (double check that our code actually uses all of these packages)

The next section details data necessary to complete this project as well as how to obtain it.
