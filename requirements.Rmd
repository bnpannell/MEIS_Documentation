# Software Requirements

To recreate California's study or to perform studies in additional areas, specialized software is needed to obtain and process Federal data. Fortunately all software is free and available online.(Where possible, make sure to use the most recent and fully updated versions of the software).


1. The R coding language from [cloud.r-project.org](https://cloud.r-project.org/). This language is used to obtain and process data.

2. RStudio Desktop from [rstudio.com](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). RStudio is the integrated development environment (IDE) used to run R scripts and develop code.

3. Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads). A comprehensive guide to installing Git is available at [happygitwithr.com](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html). Git allows version control of edits across a multi-person team of researchers. 

4. If a Github account is needed, one can sign up and register at <https://github.com/>. Individual free plans are available, as well as [free upgrades](https://help.github.com/en/articles/applying-for-an-educator-or-researcher-discount) for qualifying academic purposes.Github is used to develop and host this project. 


The next section details data necessary to complete this project as well as how to obtain it.
