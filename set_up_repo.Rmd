# Setting Up the Repository

## Obtain Repository
Instructions on how to get repo containing code and raw data provided to end users.

Include link to repo and specifically Readme.md file (won't be able to link this until that repo finds its forever home)

Do we want to have a chapter on just setting up the repo and running through each section and file it contains? AKA a data dictionary for the Repo? To insert before the methods section?? 
So maybe 2 additional sections
