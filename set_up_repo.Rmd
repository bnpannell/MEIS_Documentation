# Setting Up the Repository
Our code repository is necessary to repeat the California study. It may also be used as a frame work to run additional studies outside of the initial region. These instructions assume you will be using Github to obtain and manage a copy of the repository. 

## Obtain Repository
1. Using Github, navigate to the repository ([LINK TO REPO FOREVER HOME HERE]) and fork the repository to the user's account. 
2. Clone the repository to a new RStudio Project. 
3. Open the 'README.md' file ([LINK])  
Include link to repo and specifically Readme.md file (won't be able to link this until that repo finds its forever home)

Do we want to have a chapter on just setting up the repo and running through each section and file it contains? AKA a data dictionary for the Repo? To insert before the methods section?? 
So maybe 2 additional sections
