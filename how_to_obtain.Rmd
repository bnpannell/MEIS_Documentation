# How to Obtain Necessary Data

This section details how to obtain each data type, whose categories are defined in the "requirements" section 

### Obtainable With Code
Unfortunately, there is no simple way to obtain employment data with code.

### Manual Data Retrieval 
Employment data was obtained from 2 websites - 1 for civilian employment figures, and 1 for military employment. There is no guarantee that these websites will exist in this form indefinitely, and care will be taken to keep this document as up to date as possible.

- Civilian employment: Obtained from the federal OFfice of Personnel Management's (OPM) FedScope website, which provides federal workforce data. Given that the report works based on federal fiscal years, the employment data of interest is of Quarter 3 of a given year (i.e. September). From this site, one can grab the civilian employment numbers for the Departments of Defense (which is an aggregate of the Air Force, Army, Defense, and Navy cabinet agencies), Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs, and Energy. 

- Military employment: Obtained from the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) website, which serves under the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Similar to civilian employment, the data of interest is from September of a given year. The data referenced is the "Military and Civilian Personnel by Service/Agency by State/Country" Excel file, available under DoD Personnel, Workforce Reports & Publications on the DMDC website.
