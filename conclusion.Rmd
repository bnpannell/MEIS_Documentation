# Conclusion/ Discussion

- Importance of modern techniques to get more efficient data analysis in a timely fashion 
- Other closing remarks

Pitfalls, how refactoring code caught some of them. How this process will result in a more robust study over subsequent years

Government spending data is very difficult to obtain and there is not a lot of good documentation to help lay people use this data
Hopefully we provide some guidelines and aid in discovering and processing this data so that quality studies can come about and 
Government spending can become more transparent.

Feel good hopeful stuff next.
