# Methods
The following section details how to use the data and R code provided as well as an explanation of how the code works. 


## Set Up Repository
Instructions on how to get repo containing code and raw data provided to end users.

Include link to repo and specifically Readme.md file (won't be able to link this until that repo finds its forever home)

Do we want to have a chapter on just setting up the repo and running through each section and file it contains? AKA a data dictionary for the Repo? To insert before the methods section?? 
So maybe 2 additional sections 

### Download Necessary R Packages
dplyr, httr, jsonlite, openxlsx, readxl, tidyverse (double check that our code actually uses all of these packages)

### Parameters File Instructions
Include detailed info on Parameters file and how to set it up for a specific project. Default entries are for this study of California. 
Readme will eventually link to this section 

## Make User Specific Data Files
Edit framework files in raw data of repo and move into appropriate section of repo.

Here is where you obtain your employment data and make the region specific file to read in those numbers (if we don't just put them in the parameters file?) 

## The Code
Some words here, maybe a rough over view of the process before getting into the specific details? 

### DEPRECATED Master Code
Explanation of code
Clear Environment
Load Libraries
Load Parameters File

Load Functions
- obtain USAspending
- filter USAspending
- split USAspenging


- Process data 
  - Clean contracts and grant data- 
  - Clean spending data
  - Error check contract spending data 
  
  Will need to go into detail about changes in the code between this year (2021) and subsequent years

  More detailed mention of how the error checking of the USASpending.gov contract data is needed
  A detailed walk through of how to manually check data and use the multiple NAICS to IMPLAN crosswalks to catch data
  Mention how IMPLAN automatically removes any codes having to do with construction so those have to be manually coded

  Some errors occur due to the transaction not being given a NAICS code, those need to be manually fixed

  Issues occur with NAICS codes that apply to multiple IMPLAN codes- give detailed explanation of how this was worked around and data was processed and added back to the main cleaned data.
