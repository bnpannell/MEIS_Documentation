# Methods
The following section details how to use the data and R code provided as well as an explanation of how the code works. 

## Process Outline
The over all process for this project is as follows:

- Data was Obtained
- Data was Filtered for relevance.
- Errors in data were for checked and repaired where found.
- Data was formatted for use in IMPLAN. 
- Data was run through IMPLAN.
- IMPLAN outputs were graphically displayed and distributed via report. 

# Process in Detail





- Obtain data 
  - Spending data
    - Grants
    - Contracts
    - SmartPay (FOIA Required)
    
  - Employment Data
    - Military Personnel
    - Civilian Employment
    
    DMDC- download and parse csv
    FedScope- Initially have users go to website and save values of interest to a separate csv file to use in IMPLAN later
    Eventually set up a code to generate these values acording to state and national level based on parsing out the download from
    the site. 
    
  - NAICS to IMPLAN crosswalks

  - Spreadsheets provided to aid processing and format outputs 
  
- Process data 
  - Clean contracts and grant data- 
  - Clean spending data
  - Error check contract spending data 
  
  Will need to go into detail about changes in the code between this year (2021) and subsequent years

  More detailed mention of how the error checking of the USASpending.gov contract data is needed
  A detailed walk through of how to manually check data and use the multiple NAICS to IMPLAN crosswalks to catch data
  Mention how IMPLAN automatically removes any codes having to do with construction so those have to be manually coded

  Some errors occur due to the transaction not being given a NAICS code, those need to be manually fixed

  Issues occur with NAICS codes that apply to multiple IMPLAN codes- give detailed explanation of how this was worked around and data was processed and added back to the main cleaned data. 

- Run Data Through IMPLAN
At this point we stop giving details to users about subsequent processes- we are not responsible for teaching users how to use IMPLAN. 
We should go over the general steps in what we did next to process data from IMPLAN, and how it was displayed graphically to educate the customers and
summarize results for easier understanding
